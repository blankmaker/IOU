There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for each heading. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  > My City

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  > Help your out-of-town friends by sharing your recommendations on the best places to go. 

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  > Often, out-of-town friends will ask for local recommendations on where to eat, where to hang out, and things to check out. Rather than repeating yourself over-and-over  again, just send them a link to your My City page, which will have all the recommendations on an easy to read map. 

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  > When you live in a popular city, like NYC, SF, London, etc.. friends (close and distant) will likely come for a visit. As a result, you end up writing the same email again and again on where to go and what to check out. 

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  > My City eliminates this problem by allowing you to curate a map with your local recommendations so that you can easily send to friends. 

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  > "Help out of towners experience your version of your city"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  > Log-on and start marking off places on a map with where your friends should visit with a short note about why. Next time your friends ask for recommendations, just send them your My City link!

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  > "I used to copy/paste my emails to out-of-towner friends on places to hang out. It was so time-consuming! Or worst.. so many friends come to visit New York, that I can't respond to them all. This made it so easy"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  > "Start making your list now on mycityrecs.com
